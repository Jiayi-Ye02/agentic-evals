# agentic-evals

`agentic-evals` is a target-driven evaluation repo for testing one skill at a time.

This repo defines:

- the evaluator contract in `AGENT.md`
- the target under test in `targets/<target_id>/target.yaml`
- the active suites and cases under `targets/<target_id>/`
- the run artifacts written to `runs/<run_id>/`

The repo contract keeps Codex as the evaluator runtime.
Case execution may run in Codex or Kiro as long as the evaluator honors the artifact contract and records the chosen execution runtime in `manifest.json.execution_runtime`.

## Run Modes

The repo supports 2 evaluator-facing run modes:

- `single-run`: evaluate one local target-skill workspace
- `ab-urls`: evaluate 2 isolated target-skill variants prepared from GitHub URLs, then compare them

`ab-urls` is additive.
It does not change the meaning of targets, suites, cases, assertions, or per-case statuses.

```

## Document Responsibilities

- `README.md`: human-facing repo guide for understanding and editing the test set.
- `AGENT.md`: canonical evaluator-facing repo contract.
- `docs/session-evidence.md`: canonical contract for Codex-judged runtime evidence and child-session or hook-trace location.
- `.agents/skills/skills-evaluation/SKILL.md`: operational instructions for the `skill-eval` evaluator skill, not the source of truth for repo assertions or statuses.

## How To Read This Repo

- Read `AGENT.md` if you are changing evaluator behavior or validating repo contract rules.
- Read `targets/<target_id>/target.yaml`, suite files, and case files when editing the test set.
- Inspect `runs/` when reviewing actual execution output.

Examples in this README use `voice-ai-integration` as the target id.

## A/B Usage

Recommended first-version URL shape:

- `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/tree/<ref>/<subdir>`

This is preferred because it encodes both the git ref and the exact skill root.

Supported URL families for variant acquisition:

- `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/tree/<ref>/<subdir>`
- `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/archive/refs/heads/<branch>.tar.gz`
- `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/archive/refs/tags/<tag>.tar.gz`
- `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/archive/<commit>.tar.gz`

Example A/B prompts:

```text
用 skill-eval 以 ab 模式测试 target_id=voice-ai-integration
variant_a_url=https://github.com/org/repo/tree/main/.agents/skills/voice-ai-integration
variant_b_url=https://github.com/org/repo/tree/rewrite/.agents/skills/voice-ai-integration
suite_ids=workflow,routing
```

```text
用 skill-eval 做 A/B 测试
target_id=voice-ai-integration
A=https://github.com/org/repo/tree/main/.agents/skills/voice-ai-integration
B=https://github.com/org/repo/tree/feature-x/.agents/skills/voice-ai-integration
case_id=auth-prefers-rtc-token
```

## A/B Artifact Layout

An `ab-urls` run writes a top-level comparison wrapper plus 2 variant-local `single-run` directories:

```text
agentic-evals/runs/<ab_run_id>/
├── manifest.json
├── variants/
│   ├── A/
│   │   ├── source-manifest.json
│   │   └── run/
│   │       ├── manifest.json
│   │       ├── case-artifacts/
│   │       ├── transcript.md
│   │       ├── case-results/
│   │       └── report.md
│   └── B/
│       ├── source-manifest.json
│       └── run/
│           ├── manifest.json
│           ├── case-artifacts/
│           ├── transcript.md
│           ├── case-results/
│           └── report.md
├── comparison.json
└── report.md
```

Meaning:

- `variants/<label>/run/` is still a normal single-version run shape
- `source-manifest.json` records how each URL was parsed and resolved
- `comparison.json` and the top-level `report.md` summarize case-by-case differences

## What Usually Changes

Most manual edits in this repo land in one of these places:

- `targets/<target_id>/target.yaml` when the default suites, entry skill, or allowed statuses change
- `targets/<target_id>/cases/<suite_id>/suite.yaml` when grouping active cases
- `targets/<target_id>/cases/<suite_id>/<case_id>.yaml` when adding or refining active behavior checks

The evaluator execution protocol lives in `AGENT.md`, not here.

## Case Authoring

Add active cases under `targets/<target_id>/cases/<suite_id>/` alongside the `suite.yaml` that references them.

Keep cases focused and behavior-first:

- Lock down one specific rule per case.
- Keep `input.user_prompt` realistic and `setup` minimal.
- Write assertions as natural-language rubric entries.
- Use `assert.summary` for the case-level behavior being protected.
- Use `evidence_scope` to point the evaluator to artifact filenames such as `accepted-session.json`, `raw-hook-trace.jsonl`, `final-answer.txt`, or any combination of them.
- Prefer `accepted-session.json` when the case should read the canonical raw judge log artifact for the accepted attempt.
- Write trace-facing assertions against authoritative runtime evidence semantics such as consultation of a file, an observed command invocation, ordering, and the final answer.
- Make sure any setup can be reproduced inside an isolated case workspace.

Each case should include:

- `case_id`
- `title`
- `input`
- `setup`
- optional `assert.summary`
- `assert.required`
- `assert.forbidden`
- `notes`

Minimal case skeleton:

```yaml
case_id: "example-case"
title: "Short behavior-oriented title"

input:
  user_prompt: "Realistic user request"
  locale: "en-US"

setup:
  docs_index_present: true

assert:
  summary: "The assistant should consult the skill and then follow the supported path."
  required:
    - description: "The accepted session evidence should show that the top-level skill instructions were consulted before answering."
      pass_criteria:
        - "The accepted session evidence shows consultation of `.agents/skills/<target_id>/SKILL.md` before the answer."
      fail_signals:
        - "The accepted session evidence never shows consultation of `.agents/skills/<target_id>/SKILL.md`"
      evidence_scope:
        - "accepted-session.json"
  forbidden: []

notes:
  why_it_matters: "Why this behavior is worth protecting."
  likely_fix_files:
    - ".agents/skills/<target_id>/SKILL.md"
```

## Validation

- This command validates all case, suite, and target YAML files for the selected target by loading them with Ruby. If every file parses successfully, it prints `yaml-ok`.

```bash
TARGET_ID=voice-ai-integration ruby -e 'require "yaml"; Dir["targets/#{ENV.fetch("TARGET_ID")}/cases/*/suite.yaml"].sort.each { |f| YAML.load_file(f) }; Dir["targets/#{ENV.fetch("TARGET_ID")}/cases/**/*.yaml"].sort.reject { |f| f.end_with?("suite.yaml") }.each { |f| YAML.load_file(f) }; YAML.load_file("targets/#{ENV.fetch("TARGET_ID")}/target.yaml"); puts "yaml-ok"'
```

- This command checks suite-to-case coverage for the selected target. It reports how many case files exist, how many suite references were found, and whether any cases are missing or referenced more than once.

```bash
TARGET_ID=voice-ai-integration ruby -e 'require "yaml"; target_id = ENV.fetch("TARGET_ID"); refs = Dir["targets/#{target_id}/cases/*/suite.yaml"].sort.flat_map { |f| YAML.load_file(f)["cases"] }; counts = Hash.new(0); refs.each { |r| counts[r] += 1 }; cases = Dir["targets/#{target_id}/cases/**/*.yaml"].sort.reject { |f| f.end_with?("suite.yaml") }; missing = cases.reject { |c| counts.key?(c) }; dupes = counts.select { |_, v| v > 1 }; puts "cases=#{cases.size} suite_refs=#{refs.size} dupes=#{dupes.size} missing=#{missing.size}"'
```

## Maintenance

- Keep suites thematic and readable.
- Prefer concrete session evidence over vague review criteria.
- Audit for YAML parse errors, duplicate suite references, and unreferenced cases whenever the test set changes.
- Refresh affected suites and cases when the target workflow changes.
- Remove or rewrite stale cases that no longer reflect the supported path.
